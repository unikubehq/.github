We have officially started Unikube in 2020. We released version 1.0 of our SaaS platform and CLI (Command Line Interface) as an open-source project in September 2021. We are a team of Devs and DevOps creating tooling 🔧 around ☁️ Cloud Native Development, to enhance workflows, collaboration, security and development speed 🏃 under the umbrella ⛱ of the Unikube organization.

## 🚀 Unikube in a nutshell

Simply put, Unikube helps developers focus on what they do best: Writing code. That's because Unikube eliminates the need for developers to learn complex Kubernetes logic or deal with infrastructure.

-   🙌. Unikube standardizes and automates the application development process for service-based architectures running on Kubernetes.  
      
    
-   Working with Unikube means 👑 significantly more efficient software development, faster onboarding, better testing and error-free deployments.
